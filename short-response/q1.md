# Question

Is ReactRouter a package for **client-side routing** or **server-side routing**?

# Answer

<!-- ReactRouter is a package for both client. 
I could've sworn I changed the answer to this.... -->

This is just client-side routing because, for an example, whenever a user changes to a different route, ReactRouter prevents it so the server doesn't get a new request which would then refresh the page.

Basically ReactRouter prevents a full on refresh from ever going on since there are no new request being sent.

You got it! Elements are being rendered depending on which route they are currently on!
