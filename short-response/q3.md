# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

<!-- It's appropriate to use the `"*"` path when a user enters a path that doesn't exist -->

So more or less, if a route not explicitly defined, `"*"` is the end all be all; meaning in some ways it acts like the `else` in an `if else` statement?

Maybe I'm getting too colorful with my break down but just to reiterate, if the route isn't specified, go `"*"` <-- here?

In the case of a user putting in a route that isn't already specified, they will be routed to here --> `"*"`

# Feedback

Yup! Because the route doesn't exist, they will be rerouted to the not found page!
