# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

<!-- 3 and 4 since both of them have an `"id:"` in it with the number 5 being there. shout out to chris for correcting me-->

I had assumed that 4 since the 5 was there and is an id of sorts, it would technically work; but I understand in this case it wouldn't fit the path since 4 isn't the exact path of `/products/:id`.

Instead 2 and 3 would be the answer to this.

<!-- I was stuck on this idea that the id MUST equal a number so i didn't think `apple` would be correct :( -->

# Feedback

Love your comments! When you create routes, you are essentially creating a pattern for a url to follow. Which is why in this case the pattern is `/products/:someValue`.
